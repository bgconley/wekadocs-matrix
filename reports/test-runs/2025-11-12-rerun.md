# Verification Rerun – 2025-11-12

## Summary
- Re-ran the automated test suite (`pytest`) to validate the multi-vector Qdrant, tokenizer safety, reconciliation, and GitHub integration fixes.
- Python bytecode compilation succeeded for `src/` and `tests/`, indicating no syntax regressions.

## Results
| Check | Command | Outcome | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test suite | `pytest` | ❌ Failed | Environment missing dependency `fastapi` (required by `tests/conftest.py`). Unable to install because outbound package index access is blocked (HTTP 403 via proxy). |
| Syntax check | `python -m compileall src tests` | ✅ Passed | All modules compiled without error. |

## Follow-up
- Acquire the required dependencies (e.g., run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in an environment with package index access) and re-run `pytest` to fully validate the fixes.
