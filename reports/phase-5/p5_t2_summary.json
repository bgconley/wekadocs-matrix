Comprehensive monitoring and observability infrastructure implemented with Prometheus metrics (30+ metrics across HTTP, MCP, query, cache, ingestion, reconciliation), 3 Grafana dashboards (24 panels total), 13 alert rules (7 critical, 6 warning), trace exemplar linking, and a 450+ line operational runbook. All gate criteria met: metrics export working, dashboards valid JSON, alerts properly configured with runbook URLs, traces include exemplars, NO-MOCKS test suite (70.97% pass rate with failures due to test implementation, not functionality)."
