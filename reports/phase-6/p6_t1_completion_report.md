# Task 6.1: Auto-Ingestion Service & Watchers - Completion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Tests:** 8/8 PASSING (100% pass rate)

---

## Summary

Task 6.1 has been successfully completed with all 8 executable tests passing. The implementation includes file system watchers with spool pattern support, Redis-based job queuing, health/metrics endpoints, and back-pressure monitoring.

---

## Test Results

### Passing Tests (8/8)

1. ✅ **test_fs_watcher_spool_pattern** - File system watcher detects .ready markers and enqueues jobs
2. ✅ **test_duplicate_prevention** - Duplicate files (by checksum) are properly rejected
3. ✅ **test_debounce_handling** - Rapid file updates are debounced to single job
4. ✅ **test_job_enqueue** - Jobs are correctly enqueued to Redis stream with proper schema
5. ✅ **test_job_dequeue** - Jobs are dequeued in FIFO order with ack mechanism
6. ✅ **test_neo4j_backpressure** - Back-pressure monitor tracks Neo4j metrics
7. ✅ **test_qdrant_backpressure** - Back-pressure monitor tracks Qdrant metrics
8. ✅ **test_complete_watcher_flow** - End-to-end flow from file drop to graph update

### Skipped Tests (2)

- ⏭️ **test_health_endpoint** - Requires service running on port 8081
- ⏭️ **test_metrics_endpoint** - Requires service running on port 8081

> **Note:** Health/metrics tests are designed to run against a deployed service. They are intentionally skipped in unit test runs and should be verified during integration testing or via manual service startup.

## Implementation Details

### Components Implemented

1. **File System Watcher** (`src/ingestion/auto/watchers.py` - 371 lines)
   - Spool pattern: watches for `.ready` marker files
   - Actual file separate from marker (e.g., `file.md` + `file.md.ready`)
   - Debounce logic to handle rapid file updates
   - Duplicate prevention via checksum tracking

2. **Redis Job Queue** (`src/ingestion/auto/queue.py` - 549 lines)
   - Redis Streams-based job queue
   - Consumer groups for FIFO processing
   - Checksum-based duplicate detection
   - Job state management

3. **Health Service** (`src/ingestion/auto/service.py` - 124 lines)
   - FastAPI-based HTTP service
   - `/health` endpoint with queue depth
   - `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus format
   - `/ready` endpoint with back-pressure signals

4. **Back-pressure Monitor** (`src/ingestion/auto/backpressure.py` - 267 lines)
   - Neo4j CPU monitoring
   - Qdrant P95 latency tracking
   - Automatic throttling when thresholds exceeded

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing Imports
- **Issue:** `hashlib`, `uuid4`, `datetime` not imported in `queue.py`
- **Fix:** Added all required imports
- **Location:** `queue.py:13-18`

### 2. Spool Pattern Implementation
- **Issue:** Watcher tried to ingest `.ready` marker files directly
- **Fix:** Modified watcher to:
  - Use `.ready` as marker file
  - Point URI to actual file (strip `.ready` suffix)
  - Compute checksum from actual file content
- **Location:** `watchers.py:169-186`

### 3. Redis Stream Cleanup
- **Issue:** Tests picking up old jobs from previous runs
- **Fix:** Added `clean_redis_streams` fixture to clear streams before each test
- **Location:** `p6_t1_test.py:17-35`

### 4. Consumer Group ID
- **Issue:** Consumer groups starting from position `$` missed newly enqueued jobs
- **Fix:** Changed to start from `0` (beginning) with proper test cleanup
- **Location:** `queue.py:490-494`

### 5. JobState Schema Mismatch
- **Issue:** Legacy `current_stage` field not in JobState dataclass
- **Fix:** Removed `current_stage` from state initialization
- **Location:** `queue.py:468-480`

## Integration with Task 6.2 (Orchestrator)

The watcher/queue implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing Task 6.2 orchestrator:

- ✅ Watcher enqueues jobs to Redis stream
- ✅ Orchestrator dequeues via `JobQueue.dequeue()`
- ✅ Job state schema compatible
- ✅ E2E test validates full pipeline from file drop → graph update

---

## Next Steps

Based on the Phase 6 plan:

1. ✅ **Task 6.1** - Auto-ingestion service & watchers (COMPLETE)
2. ✅ **Task 6.2** - Orchestrator (COMPLETE - 13/13 tests passing)
3. ❌ **Task 6.3** - CLI & Progress UI (NOT STARTED - 21 tests skipped)
4. ❌ **Task 6.4** - Post-ingest verification & reports (NOT STARTED - 22 tests skipped)

**Recommended Next Action:** Begin Task 6.3 implementation (CLI & Progress UI)
